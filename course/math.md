- 弧度是角的度量单位。它是由国际单位制导出的单位，单位缩写是rad。定义：弧长等于半径的弧，其所对的圆心角为1弧度.根据定义，一周的弧度数为2πr/r=2π，360°角=2π弧度，因此，1弧度约为57.3°，即57°17'44.806''，1°为π/180弧度，近似值为0.01745弧度，周角为2π弧度，平角（即180°角）为π弧度，直角为π/2弧度

## 基础

- 数学思维导论 Introduction to Mathematical Thinking:Learn how to think the way mathematicians do – a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years. Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

- [Calculus: Single Variable Part 1 – Functions（单变量微积分1：函数）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-single-variable-calculus):Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach. In this first part–part one of five–you will extend your understanding of Taylor series, review limits, learn the _why_ behind l’Hopital’s rule, and, most importantly, learn a new language for describing growth and decay of functions: the BIG O.

	- 将复合波形拆解构成简单波形
	- 一个函数，输入一串数字代表样本值，输出一串复数代表频率分量
	- 输入 N 个实数，代表采样值
	- 输出为 N 个复数，代表不同频率的分量，忽略复数的实部和虚部，只关心它的模，也就是绝对值,每个数字具体代表的频率可以根据样本数量和采样频率计算得知,不关心复数的方向，我们只关心复数的模
	- 输出的结果是左右对称的，因此只有一半的信息有价值

## 图论

- 图是一个三元组 ⟨V(G),E(G),ϕG⟩\langle V(G),E(G),\phi_G \rangle⟨V(G),E(G),ϕG​⟩，其中 V(G)V(G)V(G) 是一个非空的结点集合，E(G)E(G)E(G) 是边集合，ϕG\phi_GϕG​ 是从边集合 EEE 到结点集合上的函数。

### 有向与无向

- 无向边：若边 ei 与结点无序偶 (vj,vk) 相关联，则称该边为 无向边。即边所连两个结点没有顺序关系。
- 有向边：若边 ei 与结点有序偶 ⟨vj,vk⟩ 相关联，则称该边为 有向边。即边所连两个结点存在顺序关系。
- 有向图：每一条边都是有向边的图称为 有向图。
- 无向图：每一条边都是无向边的图称为 无向图。
- 混合图：一些边有向一些边无向的图称为 混合图。

### 邻接与孤立

- 邻接点：若两个结点之间存在边相连，则这两个结点称为 邻接点。
- 邻接边：若两条边关联同一个结点，则这两条边称为 邻接边。
- 孤立点：不与任何结点相邻接的结点，称为 孤立结点 或 孤立点。
- 零图：仅有孤立结点组成的图称为 零图。
- 平凡图：仅有一个孤立结点的图称为 平凡图。
- 稀疏图：边的条数 ∣E∣|E|∣E∣ 不超过 ∣V∣2|V|^2∣V∣2 的图称为 稀疏图（Sparse Graph），即边数很少的图。
- 稠密图：边的条数 ∣E∣|E|∣E∣ 很接近 ∣V∣2|V|^2∣V∣2 的图称为 稠密图（Dense Graph），即边数很多的图。
- 环：关联于同一结点的一条边称为 自回路或环。环的方向是没有意义的，因此环可以称为无向边也可以称为有向边。

  - 数学是研究数量、结构、变化以及空间模型等概念的一门学科。透过抽象化和逻辑推理的使用，由计数、计算、量度和对物体形状及运动的观察中产生。数学家们拓展这些概念，为了公式化新的猜想以及从合适选定的公理及定义中建立起严谨推导出的真理。
