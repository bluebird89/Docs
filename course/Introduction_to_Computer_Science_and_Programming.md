- 教材 Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: With Application to Understanding Data Guttag, John. 

- skills
	- computational thinking
	- read code
	- unstanding ablitis and limiits

	
	## rules
	
	55% coem from problem sets
	forword question start down the right path

take note has better effort
use notes to take your own annotations  

## computation

- knowledge
	- declarative
	- imperative description of how to deduce something
-  to capture the steps of computation
-  stored-program computer
	-  memory
	-  pc
	-  alu
	-   contol unit
-   program is a recipe
	-  fixed set of primitives
-  six primitives
-  language
	-  high vs low
	-  general vs targeted
	-  interpreter vs compiled
		-  easy debug but slow
-  python
	-  syntax legal expressions
	-  static semantics 语义 meaning
	-  semantics what happen when run
-  program style
	-  don't change arbitrarily
	-  comments
	-  choices of variable names

### values

### numbers

- int
- floats

### strings

#### operators

- assign
	- pointer
- comparison
- logical

#### variables

-  binding is dynamic
	-  operators will reload
-  keywords excluded

#### expression

- `3+'ab'`
- type checking
	- `3 < 'a'`
	- `4< '3'` 
	- `'4' < '3'`
- type disciplined
- operator precedence
	- use parens

#### statement

- legal command that python can interpreter

## control of flow 

- colon block of code start 
- enter end of block of code
- branching

### conditionals

- boolean condition
- nestings

### iteration
